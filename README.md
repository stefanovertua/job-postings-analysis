# HIRING TRENDS FOR DATA ANALYST POSITIONS

## Overview

Data analysts have become indispensable across industries as organizations increasingly adopt data-driven strategies. The growing reliance on data as a core asset has driven a significant surge in demand for skilled professionals. However, the available talent pool has not kept pace, leaving many companies struggling to fill roles and fully leverage data for competitive advantage.

The objective of this analysis is to provide an overview of job postings for Data Analyst roles across all 50 US states in 2019, using data sourced from the popular job platform, Glassdoor.

The analysis was conducted using Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) and is based on a dataset that can be downloaded here.

The report offers a detailed visualization of job applications and hiring trends for Data Analyst roles in 2019. It highlights key metrics such as hiring rates, applicant distribution by job title and location, and temporal trends. By providing a comprehensive breakdown of these insights, the project serves as a valuable resource for understanding recruitment patterns, identifying high-demand roles, and informing workforce planning strategies.

This project leverages Looker Studioâ€™s capabilities to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes key trends and delivers actionable insights for optimizing recruitment strategies and addressing talent shortages in the data analytics field.
